# 🤖 NAO Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) System

An AI-powered natural language interface for the NAO humanoid robot with Myanmar language support. This system enables NAO to interact with humans through speech, gestures, and programmed responses using generative AI.

## 🔍 Overview
This project enhances NAO’s capabilities using a cloud-based language model (e.g., GPT API), enabling responsive conversations and interaction in the Myanmar language. Developed as part of a national-level research initiative.

## 🚀 Features
- 🗣️ Natural language understanding (Myanmar + English)
- 🧠 AI-based dialogue system using generative models
- 🕹️ Gesture control and motion synchronization
- 🎤 Speech-to-text and text-to-speech integration
- 🌐 Websocket/REST communication with NAO robot

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- `NAOqi` (Python SDK for NAO)
- `SpeechRecognition`, `pyttsx3`, `gTTS`
- `FastAPI` or `Flask` (backend)
- `OpenAI API` or `custom GPT model`
- Myanmar Language NLP toolkit (optional)
